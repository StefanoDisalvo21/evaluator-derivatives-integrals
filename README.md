# Derivatives and Integrals Evaluator ∫
## About
    The project started during my last year
    of high school and aims to apply mathematical
    knowledge without leaving it only concepts.
    The project itself isn't anything new but it
    has been thought to be a way to learn different
    concepts (see goals) and apply maths which is 
    one of my biggest passion.
    Updates will be delivered as soon as I can
    but there is no delivery date.
    I started to work on project like that
    because I want to do more than we do
    at school so here I am doing errors and
    trying to improve daily.
## Goals 🎯
    - Learn about Data Structure
    - Learn how to parse expressions
    - Apply mathematical knowledge
    - Learn about algorithms
